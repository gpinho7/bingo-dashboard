# Bingo Game 🎲

- My family loves board games.
- We used to have one of those home bingo games with a manual wheel and the number balls, though after some years most balls were lost but the hype for some family bingo nights was not!
- So I decided to create this very simple number drawer, because why not?

### ✨ Future Work 

- Not sure to be honest. I just wanted to create an easy bingo drawer for the game nights with my family, might make it better somehow.
- Maybe create an .exe to make it easier to run
